    <h1>Drug Overdose Deaths Analysis Report (2008-2022)</h1>
    <p>Over the last 10+ years, drug overdoses have become a top killer in the Nation among adults. This report focuses specifically on a community that has faced quickly increasing trends in overdose deaths in the last 10+ years. La Crosse County, Wisconsin sits on the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin. Steep overdose trends in the La Crosse area along with the loss of a dear friend from La Crosse due to an accidental overdose are the inspiration for this analysis. I pray that this report can provide awareness about how dangerous this pandemic really is.</p>

    <h2>Trends in Overdose Deaths</h2>
    <h3>Accidental and Intentional Overdose Deaths Over Time</h3>
    <img src="./Images/deaths_per_year.png" alt="Overdose Trends">
    <p>Summary: The number of drug overdoses in La Crosse County has surged dramatically over the past two decades. In 2008, there were five recorded deaths due to drug overdoses. By 2020, this number had escalated to 40 deaths in that year alone. Although there was a slight decrease in overdose deaths in 2021, the data from 2022 indicates that the fight against drug abuse is far from over. One possible explanation for the brief decline in deaths could be the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced social interactions due to strict quarantine measures. This might also account for the increase in overdose deaths following the easing of these regulations in 2021. This hypothesis is supported by national statistics from the CDC, which reported:
        <blockquote>"December 17, 2020: The CDC records the highest number of drug overdose deaths ever in a 12-month period ending in May 2020 in the U.S.—more than 81,000. Overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids (primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl) increased by 38%, methamphetamines by 35%, and cocaine (likely linked to co-use or contamination of cocaine with illicitly manufactured fentanyl or heroin) by 27%.” (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html#Early-2021" target="_blank">CDC Timeline</a>)
        </blockquote>
         
        Although comprehensive data for 2023 is not yet available, the La Crosse County Medical Examiner's office has reported the highest number of overdose deaths in the county's history, with 54 lives lost. This stark figure underscores the ongoing severity of the drug abuse crisis in our community.
